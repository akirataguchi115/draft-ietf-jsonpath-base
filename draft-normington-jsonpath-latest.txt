1.  Introduction

   JSONPath was introduced by Stefan Goessner as a simple form of XPath
   for JSON.  See his original article [Goessner].

   JSON is defined by RFC 8259 [RFC8259].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  ABNF Syntax

   The syntax in this document conforms to ABNF as defined by RFC 5234
   [RFC5234].

2.  JSONPath Syntax and Semantics

2.1.  Overview

   A JSONPath is a string which matches zero or more nodes of any JSON
   document.  A valid JSONPath conforms to the ABNF syntax defined by
   this document.

2.2.  Terminology

   A JSON document is logically a tree of nodes with the document as the
   root node of the tree.

   Each node holds a JSON value (as defined by RFC 8259 [RFC8259]) of
   one of the types object, array, number, string, or one of the
   literals "true", "false", or "null".  The type of the JSON value held
   by a node is sometimes referred to as the type of the node.

   The descendants of a node are taken to include the node itself and
   the descendants of any children of the node.

2.3.  Implementation

   An implementation of this specification, from now on referred to
   simply as "an implementation", SHOULD takes two inputs, a JSONPath
   and a JSON document, and produce a possibly empty list of nodes of
   the JSON document which match the JSONPath or an error (but not
   both).

   If there is no matching node and no error has occurred, an
   implementation MUST return an empty list of nodes.

   Syntax errors in the JSONPath SHOULD be detected before matching is
   attempted since they do not depend on the JSON document.  Therefore,
   an implementation SHOULD take a JSONPath and produce an optional
   syntax error and then, if and only if an error was not produced,
   SHOULD take a JSON document and produce a list of matches or an error
   (but not both).

   Alternatively, an implementation MAY take a JSONPath and a JSON
   document and produce a list of matches or an optional error (but not
   both).

   For any implementation, if a syntactically invalid JSONPath is
   provided, the implementation MUST return an error.

   If a syntactially invalid JSON document is provided, any
   implementation SHOULD return an error.

2.4.  Syntax

   Syntactically, a JSONPath consists of a root selector ("$"), which
   selects the root node of a JSON document, followed by a possibly
   empty sequence of _matchers_.

   json-path = root-selector *matcher
   root-selector = %x24               ; $ selects document root node

   The syntax and semantics of each matcher is defined below.

2.5.  Semantics

   The root selector "$" not only selects the root node of the input
   document, but it also produces as output a list consisting of one
   node: the input document.

   A matcher may match a node and, if it matches, may then select zero
   or more descendants of the node for further processing.  But there's
   more to it than this: each matcher acts on a list of nodes and
   produces a list of nodes, as follows.

   After the root selector, the remainder of the JSONPath is processed
   by passing lists of nodes from one matcher to the next ending up with
   a list of nodes which is the result of matching the JSONPath to the
   input JSON document.

   Each matcher acts on its input list of nodes as follows.  For each
   node in the list, the matcher may or may not match the node.  If the
   matcher matches the node, it selects zero or more descendants of the
   node.  The output list of nodes of a matcher is the concatenation of
   the lists of selected descendents for each input node.

   A specific, non-normative example will make this clearer.  Suppose
   the input document is: "{"a":[{"b":0},{"b":1},{"b":2}]}".  As we will
   see later, the JSONPath "$.a[*].b" selects the following list of
   nodes: "0", "1", "2".  Let's walk through this in detail.

   The JSONPath consists of "$" followed by three matchers: ".a", "[*]",
   and ".b".

   Firstly, "$" matches the input document and selects the root node
   which is the input document.  So the result is a list consisting of
   just the root node.

   Next, ".a" matches any input node of type object and selects any
   value of the input node corresponding to the key ""a"".  The result
   is again a list of one node: "[{"b":0},{"b":1},{"b":2}]".

   Next, "[*]" matches any input node which is an array and selects all
   the elements of the input node.  The result is a list of three nodes:
   "{"b":0}", "{"b":1}", and "{"b":2}".

   Finally, ".b" matches any input node of type object and selects any
   value of the input node corresponding to the key ""b"".  The result
   is the concatenation of three lists each of length one containing
   "0", "1", "2", respectively.

   As a consequence of this approach, if any of the matchers matches no
   nodes, then the whole JSONPath matches no nodes.

   In what follows, the semantics of each matcher are defined for each
   type of node.

2.6.  Matchers

2.6.1.  Dot Child Matcher

Syntax

   A dot child matcher has a key known as a dot child name or a single
   asterisk ("*").

   A dot child name corresponds to a key in a JSON object, without the
   surrounding double quotes (""").

   matcher = dot-child             ; see below for alternatives
   dot-child = %x2E dot-child-name / ; .<dot-child-name>
               %x2E %x2A             ; .*
   dot-child-name = TBD

   More general child names, such as the empty string, are supported by
   "Bracket Child Name" in (reference TBD).

Semantics

   A dot child name which is not a single asterisk ("*") matches any
   node which is an object having a key equal to the dot child name and
   selects the value corresponding to that key.  It does not match a
   node which is not an object.

   A dot child name consisting of a single asterisk is a wild card.  It
   matches any node which is an object and selects all the values of the
   object.  It also matches any node which is an array and selects all
   the elements of the array.  It does not match a number, string, or
   literal node.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs
   [RFC5226] for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do
   anything, the section contains an explicit statement that this is the
   case (as above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section
   will be removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

4.  Security Considerations

   This section gives security considerations, as required by RFC 3552
   [RFC3552].

5.  Alternatives

   An analogous standard, JSON Pointer, is provided by RFC 6901
   [RFC6901].
